# Just-Another-MicroKanren
A simple microkanren implementation in Racket

* This was mostly implemented from ["Logic programming in scheme" by Nils M Holm](http://bit.ly/2CorDxX)
* Note that this is still a work in progress!  I am currently reading ["The Reasoned Schemer" by Daniel P. Friedman, Willeam E. Byrd and Oleg Kiselyov ](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reasoned-schemer) and I will be making updates as I learn more from this book and from working on small projects.
